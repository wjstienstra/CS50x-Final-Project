# IDEA

# Create a website where you can create an account and subscribe to a number of companies to create automated ai reports for.
# Once you subsribe to a company. Your dashboard will populate with the latest news updates and analysis made with ai.

# The program will monitor new updates for the companies that you've subscribed to and generate a report which you will receive in your email inbox.

# The news feed is working well but can be improved.
# 1. I don't think we need the company name
# 2. Perhaps a time and date for the update is appropriate, and perhaps a news source. I need to see what data is deliverd via the api call.
#
# There are quite a lot of inconsistencies regarding engels/dutch in the code and even on the website. There is some redundant code that I'm not using anymore like the older helper functions.
#
# The company list could look better

# You can still see the remnants of finance, for instance when you fail to enter a password, it redirects to the apology, which works.
